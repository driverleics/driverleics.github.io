                  <p><span>Studies indicate an increasing demand for autonomous vehicles and there is no secret why. Having identified the ‘elimination of accidents due to manual errors; reduced carbon dioxide emissions due to lower consumption of fuel and high penetration capabilities into the automotive sector’  as a few benefits of autonomous vehicles.  It is quite evident why there is an increasing interest in the field - we may all be sitting as passengers in one of these self-driving cars in the not too distant future. Therefore, ensuring their quality (e.g. safety and trustworthiness) is paramount.
<br>
Our research concerns the quality of the software for autonomous vehicles from the model-based development and automated testing perspectives.  The DriverLeics research group develops various algorithms for autonomous vehicles  in complex urban scenarios. These algorithms are designed to test the full capabilities of a simulated  autonomous model against an autonomous agent. The challenges include accurate self-localisation, detection and classification of pedestrians against cyclists/vehicles and the safe completion of driving routes. </span></p>
